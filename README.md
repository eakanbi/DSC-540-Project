Stroke is the 5th cause of death in the Unied States. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts. As a result, part of the brain cannot recieve oxygen and blood so it and the brain cells die. In this notebook a dataset will be used to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on these attributes.
